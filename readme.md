# Project Description

This project is enhancement of [Windows Loopback Exemption Manager](https://github.com/tiagonmas/Windows-Loopback-Exemption-Manager).

GUI to enable Loopback Exemptions for Universal Windows Apps and Windows 8, 8.1, 10 Modern UI Apps.

By default, Windows Modern UI and Universal Apps are forbidden to send network traffic to the local Computer. In order to debug Apps with a tool, we need to enable Loopback capabilities for those Apps.
This tool enables the management of the Apps that can connect to the local Computer.

This tool does basically the same thing as Fiddler EnableLoopback Utility.
